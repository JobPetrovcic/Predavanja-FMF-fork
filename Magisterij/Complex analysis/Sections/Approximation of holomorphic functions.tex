\begin{lema}\label{app:lm:seg}
Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset and
$K \subseteq \Omega$ a non-empty compact. Then there exist finitely
many horizontal or vertical line segments
$\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n$ of equal length in
$\Omega \setminus K$ such that for all $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$
we have
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k=1}^n
\lint_{\sigma_k} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi
\]
for all $z \in K$.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Define
\[
\delta =
\begin{cases}
          1,           & \Omega = \C,   \\
d(K, \partial \Omega), & \Omega \ne \C.
\end{cases}
\]
Let $Q$ be a grid of squares, parallel to the coordinate axes, with
side length $d < \frac{\delta}{\sqrt{2}}$. As $K$ is compact, it
only intersects finitely many of them. Now just choose the boundary
of the union of those squares. It is clear that all those segments
are subsets of $\Omega \setminus K$.

Let $Q_k$ denote the above squares. Then,
\[
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k=1}^m \olint_{\partial Q_k}
\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi =
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k=1}^n \lint_{\sigma_k}
\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi.
\]
If $z \in \Int Q_\ell$, then
\[
f(z) =
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \lint_{\partial Q_\ell}
\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \lint_{\partial Q_k}
\frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi = 0
\]
for all $k \ne \ell$, therefore the lemma holds for all such $z$.
As both sides of the equations are continuous functions, they must
agree on the whole set $K$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}\label{app:lm:app_seg}
Let $\sigma$ be a compact line segment and $K \subseteq \C$ be a
compact set such that $K \cap \sigma = \emptyset$. Let
$h \in \mathcal{C}(\sigma)$ be a function. Then for all
$\varepsilon > 0$ there exist points $c_1, \dots, c_m \in \C$ and
$w_1, \dots, w_m \in \sigma$ such that
\[
\norm{\lint_\sigma \frac{h(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi -
\sum_{k=1}^m \frac{c_k}{z - w_k}}_K <
\varepsilon.
\]
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Let $\ell$ be the length of $\sigma$ and define the function
$v \colon \sigma \times K \to \C$ with
\[
v(\xi, z) = \frac{h(\xi)}{\xi - z}.
\]
It is clearly continuous, therefore it is uniformly continuous. In
particular, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
\[
\abs{v(\xi, z) - v(\xi', z)} < \frac{\varepsilon}{\ell}
\]
for all $z \in \C$ and $\abs{\xi - \xi'} < \delta$.

Let $\tau_1, \dots, \tau_m$ be the partition of $\sigma$ into line
segments of length $d < \sigma$. Choose points $w_k \in \tau_k$ and
set $c_k = - h(w_k) d$. We therefore have
\[
\abs{\lint_{\tau_k} v(\xi, z)\,d\xi - \frac{c_k}{z - w_k}} =
\abs{\lint_{\tau_k} v(\xi, z)\,d\xi - d \cdot v(w_k, z)} <
d \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{\ell}.
\]
Summing up, we get the desired inequality.
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}\label{app:lm:app_by_rat}
Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open set and $K \subseteq \Omega$
be a non-empty compact. Then there exist finitely many line
segments $\sigma_1, \dots, \sigma_n$ in $\Omega \setminus K$ such
that for any holomorphic function $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$ and
$\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a rational function $q$ of the form
\[
q(z) = \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{c_k}{z - w_k},
\]
where $c_k \in \C$ and $w_k \in \sigma$, such that
\[
\norm{f - q}_K < \varepsilon.
\]
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
By lemma~\ref{app:lm:seg} there exist line segments $\sigma_k$ such
that
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \sum_{k=1}^n
\lint_{\sigma_k} \frac{f(\xi)}{\xi - z}\,d\xi
\]
for all $z \in K$. Now just apply lemma~\ref{app:lm:app_seg} to
each line segment separately.
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}[Shifting poles]\index{Shifting poles lemma}
Let $K \subseteq \C$ be a compact set, $Z$ a connected component of
$\C \setminus K$ and $a, b \in Z$. Then, for all $\varepsilon > 0$
there exists a polynomial $q$ such that
\[
\norm{\frac{1}{z-a} - q \br{\frac{1}{z-b}}}_K < \varepsilon.
\]
If $Z$ is the unbounded component, we can approximate
$\frac{1}{z-a}$ by $q(z)$ instead.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Let $L_\omega$ be the family of all functions that are holomorphic
in a neighbourhood of $K$ that can be approximated uniformly on $K$
by polynomials in $\frac{1}{z-\omega}$. Note that, if
$\frac{1}{z-p} \in L_q$, then $L_p \subseteq L_q$.

Consider the set
\[
S = \setb{s \in Z}{\frac{1}{z-s} \in L_b}.
\]
We claim that $S = Z$. First note that $b \in S$, therefore
$S \ne \emptyset$. Take any point $p \in S$ and $\delta > 0$ such
that $\dsk(p, \delta) \subseteq Z$. For any
$s \in \dsk(p, \delta)$, we can write
\[
\frac{1}{z-s} =
\frac{1}{z-p} \cdot \frac{1}{1 - \frac{s-p}{z-p}} =
\frac{1}{z-p} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^\infty
\br{\frac{s-p}{z-p}}^k,
\]
which converges as $\abs{s-p} < \abs{z-p}$ by choice of $\delta$.
We conclude that $\dsk(p, \delta) \subseteq S$. In particular, $S$
is an open set. Take any point $p \in \partial S \cap Z$. Suppose
that $\dsk(p, 3 \delta) \subseteq Z$ and choose a point
$p' \in \dsk(p, \delta) \cap S$. Then,
$\dsk(p', 2\delta) \subseteq S$ and therefore
$\dsk(p, \delta) \subseteq S$, which is a contradiction and
therefore proves our claim.

Now suppose that $Z$ is the unbounded component and take a point
$d \in Z$ such that $K \subseteq \dsk(0, \abs{d})$. Then all
functions $\br{\frac{1}{z-d}}^n$ can be approximated uniformly on
$K$ by Taylor's polynomials about $0$.
\end{proof}

For any set $P \subseteq \C$ denote by $\C_P[z]$ the family of
rational functions with poles in $P$.

\begin{izrek}[Runge approximation]
\index{Runge approximation theorem}
\label{app:thm:runge_app}
Let $K \subseteq \C$ be a compact. If $P$ intersects every bounded
connected component of $\C \setminus K$, then for every function
$f$, holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $K$, and every
$\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a function $q \in \C_P[z]$ such that
\[
\norm{f-q}_K < \varepsilon.
\]
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
Be lemma~\ref{app:lm:app_by_rat}, we can find a compact union
$\sigma$ of line segments such that every such $f$ can be
approximated by
\[
\widetilde{q} = \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{c_k}{z - w_k},
\]
where $c_k \in \C$ and $w_k \in \sigma$. Suppose then
\[
\norm{f - \widetilde{q}}_K < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}.
\]
Let $Z_k$ be the connected component of $\C \setminus K$ that
contains $w_k$.

If $Z_k$ is bounded, then choose $t_k \in P \cap Z_k$. By the pole
shifting lemma, we can find a polynomial $g_k$ such that
\[
\norm{\frac{c_k}{z - w_k} - g_k \br{1}{z - t_k}}_K <
\frac{\varepsilon}{2m}.
\]
If $Z_k$ is unbounded, we can instead approximate
$\frac{c_k}{z - w_k}$ by a polynomial instead. Choosing
\[
q = \sum_{k=1}^m g_k,
\]
we find
\[
\norm{f - q}_K \leq
\norm{f - \widetilde{q}}_K + \norm{\widetilde{q} - q}_K <
\frac{\varepsilon}{2} + m \cdot \frac{\varepsilon}{2m} =
\varepsilon. \qedhere
\]
\end{proof}

Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset and let
$K \subseteq \Omega$ be a compact. If every bounded component of
$\C \setminus K$ intersects $\C \setminus \Omega$, then for every
function $f$ that is holomorphic on a neighbourhood of $K$ and
every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a function
$q \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$ such that
\[

\begin{definicija}
Let $V$ be a vector space over $\C$, equipped with a topology. Let
$T \colon V \to V$ be a linear map.

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item We call $T$ \emph{cyclic}\index{cyclic!map} if there exists
some $f \in V$, called a \emph{cyclic vector}\index{cyclic!vector},
such that
\[
\spn_\C \setb{T^n(f)}{n \in \N_0} = V.
\]
\item We call $T$ \emph{hypercyclic}\index{hypercyclic map} if
there exists some $f \in V$, such that
\[
\oline{\setb{T^n(f)}{n \in \N_0}} = V.
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{definicija}

\begin{izrek}[Birkhoff]
\index{Birkhoff's theorem}
Let $\tau \colon \C \to \C$ be given by $\tau(z) = z + a$ for some
$a \ne 0$. Then the map
$T \colon \mathcal{O}(\C) \to \mathcal{O}(\C)$, given by
$T(f) = f \circ \tau$, is hypercyclic.
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
Set $K_n = \oline{\dsk(\ell_n \cdot a, n)}$ for a sequence
$(\ell_n)_n \subseteq \N$, such that all $K_n$ are pairwise
disjoint and $K_n \cap \dsk(0, n) = \emptyset$ for all $n \in \N$.
Choose a sequence $(\varepsilon_n)_n \subseteq \R^+$, converging to
$0$. Furthermore, let $(p_n)_n$ be a sequence of all polynomials
$(\Q \oplus i\Q)[z]$.

We first construct a sequence of holomorphic functions $(f_n)_n$,
such that the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item For all $n \in \N$, we have
\[
\norm{\sum_{k=1}^n f_k - \tau^{-\ell_n} \circ p_n}_{K_n} <
\frac{\varepsilon_n}{2^n}.
\]
\item For all $m < n$, we have
\[
\norm{f_n}_{K_m} < \frac{\varepsilon_m}{2^n}.
\]
\item For all $n \in \N$, we have
\[
\norm{f_n}_{\dsk(0,n)} < \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]
\end{enumerate}

Choose $\ell_n$ such that $\dsk(0,n) \cap K_m = \emptyset$ for all
$m < n$. Then the set
\[
\C \bigsetminus \br{\bigcup_{m=1}^n K_m \cup \dsk(0,n)}
\]
is obviously connected. We can now just apply Runge's little
theorem by choosing the function $0$ on $\dsk(0,n)$ and $K_m$ for
$m < n$, and
\[
\tau^{-\ell_n} \circ p_n - \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}
\]
on $K_n$.

Note that the series
\[
f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n
\]
is uniformly convergent by the third condition. We now compute
\begin{align*}
\norm{f \circ \tau^{\ell_n} - p_n}_{\tau^{-\ell_n}(K_n)} &=
\norm{f - \tau^{-\ell_n} \circ p_n}_{K_n}
\\
&\leq
\sum_{k > n} \norm{f_k}_{K_n} +
\norm{\sum_{k=1}^n f_k - \tau^{-\ell_n} \circ p_n}_{K_n}
\\
&<
\varepsilon_n.
\end{align*}
It follows that we can approximate every rational polynomial with
iterations $T^n(f)$.

\begin{lema}
    Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset $K \subseteq \Omega$ a compact.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For every component $Z$ of $\Omega \setminus K$ we have $\Omega \cap \partial{Z} \subseteq K$. If $Z \subseteq \Omega$ is relatively compact, then $\norm{f}_Z \leq \norm{f}_K$ for all $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$.
        \item Every of $Z_0$ be a component of $\C \setminus K$ that is contained in $\Omega$ is a component of $\C \setminus K$. If $Z_0$ is bounded, then $Z_0 \subseteq \Omega$ is relatively compact.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lema}
\begin{proof}
    Let $p$ be a point in $\Omega \cap \partial{Z}$ that is not in $K$. Let $D$ be a disk centered at $p$ contained in $\Omega \setminus K$. Then every point of $D$ is in the same connected components as $p$. But then $p \notin \partial{Z}$, since $D \subseteq Z$.

    Suppose now that $Z$ is additionally relatively compact. By the above $\partial{Z} \subseteq K$ and so $\norm{f}Z = \norm{f}{\partial{Z}}\leq \norm{f}_K$ by the maximum modulus princinple.

    For the second item, let $Z_0$ be a component of $\C \setminus K$ contained in $\Omega$. There must exist a $Z_1 \subseteq \Omega \setminus K$ a connected component that contains $Z_0$. By maximality of connected component $Z_0 = Z_1$.

    Suppose it is additionally bounded. The closure of $Z_0$ in $\C$ is contained in $\Omega$ by the first item. But then it is compact as it is bounded and closed in $\Omega$.
\end{proof}

\begin{izrek}
    Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset and $K \subseteq \Omega$ a compact. The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Omega \setminus K$ has no relatively compact components,
        \item every bounded component of $\C \setminus K$ intersects $\C \setminus \Omega$
\item every function holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $K$ ca be approximated uniformly on $K$ by rational functions without poles in $\Omega$,
        \item every function holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $K$ can be approximated by a function that is holomorphic in $\Omega$,
        \item for every $p \in \Omega \setminus K$ there exists a $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$ such that $\abs{f(p)} > \norm{f}K$
        \item $\hat{K}{\mathcal{O}(\Omega)} = K$
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{izrek}
\begin{proof}
    From Approximation lemma we immediately get that 2. implies 3. Trivially, we have that 3. implies 4. Items 5. and 6. are the same by definition.

    Next we prove that 1. implies 2. If $Z_0$ is a component of $\C \setminus K$ that is contained in $\Omega$, then it is a component of $\Omega \setminus K$ and relatively compact in $\Omega$ by the previous lemma. By 1., this cannot happen so no bounded component of $\C \setminus K$ lies in $\Omega$ which is precisely 2. 

    Suppose 4. holds and $\Omega \setminus K$ has a relatively compact component $Z$. Choose $a \in Z$ and consider $f(z) = \frac{1}{z - a}$. By assumption this function can be approximated by $g \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$ so that for $\delta = \norm{z - a}_K$ we have $\norm{\frac{1}{z - a} - g}_K < \frac{1}{\delta}$. Then $\norm{1 - (z - a)g}_K < 1$. By the first item of the previous lemma, we have $\norm{1 - (z - a)g}_Z \leq \norm{1 - (z - a)g}_K < 1$. For $z = a$, this is a contradicition. This implies 1.

    Suppose 5. holds and $Z$ is a relatively compact component. As in the previous paragraph, we have that $\norm{f}_Z \leq \norm{f}_K$ for all $f \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$, in particular this holds for $f$ from the assumption of 5., which is again a contradiction. 
\end{proof}

\datum{2024-1-16}

this is the remainder of the proof that we did not finish last time, TODO merge
\begin{proof}
    Suppose $\Omega \setminus K$ has no relatively compact components. Let $p \in \Omega \setminus K$. Consider $\Omega \setminus (K \cup \set{p})$. This has the same connnected components not containing $p$ which are still not relatively compact. Removing the point $p$ does not disconnect and open connected component, so the connected component that contained $p$ is still relatively compact. We can use the fourth item from the statement on the function $g|_K = 0$ and $g(p) = 1$, which is holomorphic in a neighbourhood of $K \cup p$. Thus there exist $h$, a holomorphic function on $\Omega$ such that $\norm{g - h}_{K \cup p} < \frac{1}{2}$. Then $\norm{h}_K < \frac{1}{2} < \abs{h(p)}$ which is exactly the fifth item.
\end{proof}

\begin{lema}
    Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ is an open subset and $K \subseteq \Omega$ a compact. Then there exists a compact $K'$ such that $K \subseteq K' \subseteq \Omega$ and every bounded component of $\C \setminus K'$ intersects $\C \setminus \Omega$ and contains a compact component of $\C \setminus \Omega$.
\end{lema}
\begin{proof}
    For the case $\Omega = \C$, we can take $K' = \oline{D}_r(0)$, where $r$ is large enough so that $K \subseteq K'$. So suppose $\Omega \neq \C$. Choose $0 < \rho < d(K, \partial{\Omega}) = d(K, \C \setminus \Omega)$. Let $M = \setb{z \in \Omega}{d(z \C \setminus \Omega) \geq \rho}$. Choose $r > 0$ such that $K \subseteq \oline{D}_r(0)$. Let $K' = M \cap \oline{D}_r(0)$, which is clearly compact, contained inside $\Omega$, and contains $K$. We are left to prove the statement about the bounded components.

    Let $Z$ be a bounded component of $\C \setminus K'$. Note that $\C \setminus \oline{D}_r(0)$ is connected and unbounded and contains $Z$. If $Z$ were also not in $C \setminus M$, then it would be in the unbounded component of $\C \setminus K'$. Thus $Z \subseteq \C \setminus M$.  

    We can rewrite $\C \setminus M = \bigcup_{w \in \C \setminus \Omega} D_{\rho}(w)$ by the definition of $M$. We have that  $D_{\rho}(w) \subseteq Z$ or $D_{\rho}(w) \cap Z = \emptyset$. Thus $Z = \bigcup_{w \in Z \setminus \Omega} D_{\rho}(w)$ so $Z$ intersects $\C \setminus \Omega$. Let $S$ be the component of $\C \setminus \Omega$ that $Z$ intersects $\C \setminus \Omega \subseteq \C \setminus K'$. Then $S \subseteq Z$ since $Z$ is a maximal connected set in $\C \setminus K'$. Since $Z$ is bounded, $S$ is bounded.
\end{proof}

\begin{definicija}
    Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset. We call every bounded component of $\C \setminus \Omega$ a \emph{hole} of $\Omega$.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
    If $K$ is the Cantor set, then $\Omega = \C \setminus K$ has uncountably many holes.

\begin{izrek}[Runge's Theorem for rational apporximations]
    Let $\Omega \subseteq \C$ be an open subset $P \subseteq \C \setminus \Omega$ such that $\oline{P}$ intersects every hole of $\Omega$. Then $\C_P[z]$ is dense in $\mathcal{O}(\Omega)$.
\end{izrek}
\begin{proof}
    Let $K \subseteq \Omega$ be compact. Let $K'$ be from the previous lemma. Then $\oline{P}$ intersects every bounded componont of $\C \setminus K'$. We can thus apply the lemma \ref{app:lm:app_by_ra} on $K'$. 
\end{proof}
\begin{posledica}[Runge's theorem for polynomial approximation]
    If $\Omega$ has no holes then $\C[z]$ is dense in $\mathcal{O}(\Omega)$.
\end{posledica}
\begin{proof}
    Take $P = \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

\begin{opomba}
    This gives us another proof of the Mittag-Leffler theorem \ref{inf_prod:lm:MLTOpen}.
\end{opomba}
\begin{proof}
    Let $A = \bigcup_{k \in \N} \set{a_k} \subseteq \partial{\Omega}$. Let 
    \[
        K_j = \oline{\setb{z \in \Omega \setminus A}{\abs{z} \leq j, d(z, \partial{\Omega  \setminus A}) \geq \frac{1}{j}}},
    \] which form an exhaustion by compacts. Let $K_j'$ be the compact furnished by the previous lemma for $K_j$. Choose a subsequence $(L_j)_{j \in \N}$ of $(K_j')_{j \in \N}$ that is an exhaustion by compacts, which can be done by the properties of exhaustion, i.\ e.\ for every $K_j'$ there exists $k \in \N$ so that $K_j' \subseteq K_k \subseteq K_k'$ and apply induction.

    We may assume $K_1 \cap \oline{A} = \emptyset$. Let $A_n = A \cap (L_{n + 1} \setminus L_n)$. For each $a \in A_n$ the principal part of $q$ is holomorphic in $L_n$. By the approximation with holomorphic functions on $\Omega$, there exists $g \in \mathcal{O}(\Omega)$ such that $\norm{q - g}_{L_n} < \max(1, \abs{A_n}) 2^{- n}$. Then
    \[
        \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \norm{q_n - g_n}_{L_n} \leq \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} 2^{ - n} - 1.
    \]
    Thus the series converges uniformly on compacts.
