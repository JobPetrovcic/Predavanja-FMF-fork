\section{Infinite products}

\subsection{Definition}

\begin{definicija}
\index{infinite product}
Let $(a_k)_k$ be a sequence of complex numbers. The sequence
\[
n \mapsto \prod_{k=1}^n a_k
\]
is called the
\emph{sequence of partial products}\index{partial products} with
factors $a_k$. We denote
\[
p_{m,n} = \prod_{k=m}^n a_k.
\]
We say that the infinite product is \emph{convergent} if there
exists an index $m \in \N$ such that the limit
\[
\widehat{a}_m = \lim_{n \to \infty} p_{m,n}
\]
exists and is non-zero. We then define
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty a_k = p_{1, m-1} \cdot  \widehat{a}_m.
\]
as the limit of the infinite product.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
The limit is uniquely defined.
\end{opomba}

\begin{opomba}
An infinite product is convergent if and only if the product of all
its non-zero factors has a non-zero limit and only finitely many
factors are non-zero.
\end{opomba}
