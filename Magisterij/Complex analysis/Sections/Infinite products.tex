\section{Infinite products}

\subsection{Definition and convergence}

\begin{definicija}
\index{infinite product}
Let $(a_k)_k$ be a sequence of complex numbers. The sequence
\[
n \mapsto \prod_{k=1}^n a_k
\]
is called the
\emph{sequence of partial products}\index{partial products} with
factors $a_k$. We denote
\[
p_{m,n} = \prod_{k=m}^n a_k.
\]
We say that the infinite product is \emph{convergent} if there
exists an index $m \in \N$ such that the limit
\[
\widehat{a}_m = \lim_{n \to \infty} p_{m,n}
\]
exists and is non-zero. We then define
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty a_k = p_{1, m-1} \cdot  \widehat{a}_m.
\]
as the limit of the infinite product.
\end{definicija}

\begin{opomba}
The limit is uniquely defined.
\end{opomba}

\begin{opomba}
An infinite product is convergent if and only if the product of all
its non-zero factors has a non-zero limit and only finitely many
factors are non-zero.
\end{opomba}

\begin{lema}
Let $(a_k)_k \subseteq \R_{\geq 0}$ be a sequence such that
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty (1 - a_k) = \infty.
\]
Then
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \prod_{k=p}^n a_k = 0
\]
for all $p \in \N$. In particular, the infinite product is
divergent.
\end{lema}

\begin{proof}
Observe that
\[
0 \leq
\prod_{k=p}^n a_k \leq
\prod_{k=p}^n e^{a_k - 1},
\]
which converges to $0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definicija}
Let $X \subseteq \C$ be a set.

\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item A series
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty g_k
\]
of continuous functions $g_k \in \mathcal{C}(X)$ is
\emph{normally convergent}\index{normally convergent series} if for
every compact $K \subseteq X$ the series
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \norm{g_k}_K
\]
converges.

\item A product
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty f_k
\]
of continuous functions $f_k = 1 + g_k \in \mathcal{C}(X)$ is
\emph{normally convergent} if the series
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty g_k
\]
is normally convergent.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definicija}

\begin{definicija}
Let $X \subseteq \C$ be a set and $f_k \in \mathcal{C}(X)$ be
continuous functions. Denote
\[
p_{m,n} = \prod_{k=m}^n f_k.
\]
We say that the infinite product
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty f_k
\]
converges \emph{uniformly}\index{uniform convergence} on a set
$L \subseteq X$ if there exists an index $m \in \N$ such that
$\eval{f_k}{L}{}$ has no zeroes for $k \geq m$ and
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} p_{m,n} = \widehat{f}_k
\]
exists, is uniform on $L$ and has no zeroes on $L$. We define
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty f_k = \prod_{k=1}^{m-1} f_k \cdot \widehat{f}_m
\]
on $L$.
\end{definicija}

\begin{izrek}[Reordering of infinite products]
\index{reordering theorem}
Let
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty f_k
\]
be a normally convergent product in $X \subseteq \C$. Then there
exists a functions $f \colon X \to \C$ such that for all bijections
$\tau \colon \N \to \N$ the product
\[
\prod_{k=1}^\infty f_{\tau(k)}
\]
converges to $f$ uniformly on compacts of $X$. In particular, the
infinite product converges uniformly on compacts.
\end{izrek}

\begin{proof}
Recall that, for $w \in \dsk$, we can define
\[
\log(1+w) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} w^k.
\]
Then,
\[
\abs{\log(1+w)} \leq
\abs{w} \cdot \sum_{k=0}^\infty \abs{w}^k =
\frac{\abs{w}}{1 - \abs{w}}.
\]
In particular, if $\abs{w} \leq \frac{1}{2}$, we have
\[
\abs{\log(1+w)} \leq 2 \abs{w}.
\]
Let $L \subseteq X$ be a compact and write $f_k = 1 + g_k$. For
all $k > N$ we have $\norm{g_k}_L \leq \frac{1}{2}$, therefore we
can write
\[
\log f_k =
\log(1 + g_k) =
\sum_{\ell=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^{\ell+1}}{\ell} g_k^\ell.
\]
But then
\[
\norm{\log f_k}_L \leq 2 \norm{g_k}_L.
\]
It follows that the series
\[
\sum_{k=N}^\infty \norm{\log f_k}_L
\]
converges. But then the series
\[
h_N = \sum_{k=N}^\infty \log f_k
\]
converges absolutely, and therefore all reorderings of the series
converge as well to the same limit $h_N$.

Observe that
\[
e^{h_N} = \prod_{k=N}^\infty e^{\log f_k} = \prod_{k=N}^\infty f_k.
\]
This product therefore converges uniformly on $L$, independently of
reorderings. We now define
\[
f = \prod_{k=1}^{N-1} f_k \cdot e^{h_N}.
\]
Note that this holds for all reorderings, as they differ from a
suitable one by only finitely many transpositions.
\end{proof}
